function inheritPrototype(childObject, parentObject) {
	// As discussed above, we use the Crockfordâ€™s method to copy the properties and methods from the parentObject onto the childObject
	// So the copyOfParent object now has everything the parentObject has 
	var copyOfParent = Object.create(parentObject.prototype);

	//Then we set the constructor of this new object to point to the childObject.
	// Why do we manually set the copyOfParent constructor here, see the explanation immediately following this code block.
	copyOfParent.constructor = childObject;

	// Then we set the childObject prototype to copyOfParent, so that the childObject can in turn inherit everything from copyOfParent (from parentObject)
	childObject.prototype = copyOfParent;
